          Creating your own Personal Brand Website is one of the most powerful
          things you can do for yourself and your personal brand. According to
          the Huffington Post, over 80% of employers Google search applicants
          before inviting them to an interview, and almost 50% of them have said
          they changed their mind based on what they found online. This is only
          trending upwards; this is just the beginning. Most people scramble to
          simply change their Facebook name and remove their drunken photos, and
          while and this may be an effective hiding strategy, you need to ask
          yourself this question: you are competing for a position with tens,
          hundreds, or even thousands of other people. Do you really want to be
          hiding? This is your opportunity to stand out from the crowd. Why do
